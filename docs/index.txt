===================
incuna-notification
===================

This is a fork of django-notification with the aim of improving the process by
which alternative notice media (e.g. SMS) are integrated and used.

Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * Submission of notification messages by other apps.
 * Notification messages on signing in.
 * Notification messages via email (configurable by user).
 * Notification messages via feed.
 * Notification messages via other configurable media.
